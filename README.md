# Snake
This is my little Snake project made in Python. Unfortunately I didn't make a GUI for it, but it works great :))

The game: you have a table in which you can move you snake. The * is the head of the snake, the + is the body of the snake and 'a' is an apple.
You have 4 commands: left, right, up and down.
Enjoy!
